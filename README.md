# Progetto Universitario - Programmazione Web e Mobile

## Descrizione del Progetto

For my Bachelor's degree, I completed a final project in the "Web and Mobile Programming" course, where I developed a native Android app using Kotlin. The app is designed to manage the operations of a university cafeteria, with a focus on providing a seamless user experience across different device sizes through responsive layouts. My responsibilities extended beyond app development; I also designed the underlying SQL database and built a server using Flask. Additionally, I integrated HTTP calls into the app using Retrofit.
